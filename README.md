# Flappy Bird Game

I developed the iconic Flappy Bird game as my first project using Unity. The game is designed to run on both Windows and MacOS platforms.

## Instructions to Play:
**Windows:**
 - Navigate to the **_Flarpy_** folder.
 - Open the **_My Project.exe_** file to start the game.
   
**MacOS:**
 - Go to the **_Flarpy_mac.app/Contents/MacOS_** folder.
 - Open the **_My Project_** file.
 - Ensure the file is executable by granting the necessary permissions if required.
